## Prior experiences with CI/CD:

I've done a previous project where I set up a Jenkins pipeline to automatically integrate and deploy changes to an AWS Kubernetes cluster. I'm also doing another project that involves using GitHub actions to make every GitHub commit automatically start a new Vercel deployment.
